You need to install https://devkitpro.org/ to build gba files from your c code.

I run and test the game on the emulator VisualBoyAdvance. But any emulator will work.

In the done folder there is an example how to play your gba game in the browser using webassembly. You may need a server to serve you those files. I run the command http-server in that folder to get a local server to open in that folder. 

have fun and good luck
